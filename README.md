# Bee Vibe Earbuds

Hello! I’m Rebin Reji Vazhavilayil, and I’m excited to introduce Bee Vibe, a brand focused on delivering high-quality audio with a bold, stylish edge. This README will guide you through the unique features, development practices, and design considerations behind Bee Vibe.

## Project Overview

Bee Vibe is a brand created to offer users a premium, interactive experience with earbuds that are as eye-catching as they are functional. From AR integration to animated hotspots, the project is designed to bring the product experience to life digitally.

## Key Features

### 1. **AR Object Integration (Model Viewer)**
   - Bee Vibe earbuds include an AR model viewer for an immersive, 3D experience. Users can virtually interact with the earbuds, viewing them in their own space with realistic scaling and rotation.
   - **Tech Used**: Model Viewer API for optimized AR interaction across devices.

### 2. **Animated Hotspots with Informational Display**
   - Animated hotspots enhance the interactive experience by revealing details when clicked or hovered over. These hotspots provide specs, feature descriptions, and other important information without cluttering the main view.

### 3. **Dynamic Content Retrieval (Info and Images from Object/Array)**
   - The information displayed in the hotspots is dynamically retrieved from a structured object or array, making updates and modifications easy and efficient.

## Development Practices

### 1. **Coding Best Practices (SASS, IIFE)**
   - **SASS**: We use SCSS for modular styling, which improves maintainability and scalability. This makes it easy to keep styling consistent and manageable.
   - **IIFE**: Functional components are organized using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) to maintain modularity and avoid global namespace conflicts.

### 2. **GitHub Workflow**
   - **Branching Strategy**: Organized branching, with separate branches for new features, bug fixes, and releases.
   - **Commit Messages**: Follows best practices with descriptive messages for a clear version history.

## Contextual Considerations

### Responsive Design (Mobile vs. Tablet vs. Desktop)
   - Developed with a mobile-first approach to ensure smooth interaction across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile.
   - **Adaptive Layout**: Layouts adapt to screen sizes, ensuring that the AR model, hotspots, and other features perform well on all platforms.
